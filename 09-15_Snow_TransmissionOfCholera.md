# 9/15 - Snow ~ On the Mode of Communication of Cholera
## Literature Review
John Snow’s seminal work “On the Mode of Communication of Cholera” leverages the studious review of cases surrounding the outbreak and spread of Cholera. The first 68 pages of his work specifically focus on rigorous contact tracing of discrete Cholera outbreaks to not only describe the vectors explaining why a specific group was afflicted but also identify potential reasons as to why some groups were not. He combats the established notion that the original spread of the disease is predominately by sewage effluvia and instead posits the potential for ingestion of contaminated water based on outbreak information and intimate knowledge of the sanitary practices of the time. The culmination of this work is observed in his review of the broad street pump outbreak. In this review he describes the day by day events surrounding the evolution of cholera “attacks” and mortality in the area surrounding the pump. His diligence outlines key moments that elucidate the true water-borne transmission vector of Cholera.


There is no doubt as to the efficacy and quality of Snow’s work on display in this treatise. His diligent contact tracing in a period without centralized registries reveals a true zeal to uncover the truth of this condition and his results speak for themselves. Interestingly, this work also reveals some distinct features of Snow’s biases at the same time. Specifically, regarding lower class London. On several occasions Snow recognizes the condition of the poor in aggregate but refrains from describing specific cholera contact events for that population, choosing instead to diligently trace the condition of aristocratic and middle-class individuals. I call this out not to put a spotlight on Snow’s own classism, which was omnipresent in London at the time, but instead appreciate how epidemiological analysis of disease has shifted in the last century. It’s astounding to see how far researchers studying disease have come in not only understanding the basis of transmission, but also in the societal presentation and pressure these diseases exert. Overall, Snow’s work, while slightly marred by classist ideology of the time, is an effective example of how epidemiological study can unveil the true source of disease and lead to discrete actions that better protect the community at large.


## Questions:
1.	Snow’s work recognizes that diseases were known to have unique transmission vectors (like syphilis and sexual contact), and yet the recognition of his work by the larger medical community came far later. What are some reasons that this specific transmission vector was difficult for medical societies of the time to accept?
2.	Deaths from Cholera often happen over the course of a day in the most severe cases. Cholera isn’t always severe in its presentation, so were British people of the time more susceptible to Cholera as to produce severe responses when infected or does Snow’s results suffer from confounding bias surrounding the severity?
3.	Plague was often mythologized as the source of deadly disease outbreaks even centuries after its disappearance from Brittain. What were the social and cultural elements that prolonged the public’s memory beyond many generations?
