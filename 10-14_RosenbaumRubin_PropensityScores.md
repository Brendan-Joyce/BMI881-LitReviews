## Literature Review
Rosenbaum and Rubin’s work in “The central role of the propensity score in observational studies for causal effects” is a pivotal piece of work that describes the foundations of application of the propensity score in debiasing the analysis of observational cohorts. Since its publication, this work has gone on to inspire much of the epidemiological and medical research conducted across a wide range of disciplines. Their paper focuses mostly on the statistical tractability of a proxy measure for the condition probability of Z, the treatment, given X, the confounding covariates, provided the proxy measure is a function as fine as the original conditional probability distribution function. They then go on to discuss methods for establishing these “propensity scores” using a basic logit model and use mathematical proofs to establish assertions regarding its smoothness and validity.


What shocks me most about this paper is just how small a step forward this work takes to truly revolutionize the field of causal inference. They do not show that the conditional probability of Z given X is sufficient for debiasing the treatment assignment, that work was already done. They merely show that any proxy measure that can map down to the original distribution of Z given X meets the necessary and sufficient requirements for debiasing the confounded treatment assignment against the target outcome. They then provide an example of the propensity score in action through logistic regression models. While the latter finding is likely what ended up popularizing the method, it is staggering to see what a small amount of intuition was needed to reach that next step. The only issues I have with the paper are purely cultural and more represent how I would go about writing a paper like this today. Namely, their description of the causal inference structure relies on a lot of math jargon. Today we have more efficient methods for discussing causal inference. Secondly, I think they could have conducted some simulated inference, without seeing the results in a idealized setting it can be a bit difficult to assume the method works in the absence of their proofs. Overall, their work is clearly stated, incredibly impactful, and a truly elegant and digestible finding.


## Questions:
1.	I’ve seen simulation studies in papers coming from years as early as 1964, yet it wasn’t used here. Is simulation something that has risen in popularity with the math crowd lately or am I just  happening to find a lot of papers that use simulated data?
2.	They only call out Logistic regression for calculating propensity scores. Since its conception what other scoring functions have shown promise? How do they address the logistic regression shortcomings? I’m only aware of logistic regression for discrete treatments and linear regression for continuous treatments.
3.	What was the timeline of the impact of this study? Was it immediate or spread out over the following decades? I know that in the mid-to-late 2010s propensity scores were quite popular.
