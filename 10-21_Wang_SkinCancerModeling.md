# 10/21 - Wang ~  Assessment of Deep Learning Using Nonimaging Information and Sequential Medical Records to Develop a Prediction Model for Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer
## Literature Review
In the manuscript “Assessment of Deep Learning Using Nonimaging Information and Sequential Medical Records to develop a Prediction Model of Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer”, Dr. Wang and his collaborators explore the novel application of convolutional neural net (CNN) architectures in identifying patients at high risk for non-melanoma skin cancers. To conduct this experiment, they look to data outside of the US and assert their claims on a population of Asian patients collected within Taiwanese EHR. Instead of interpreting images of skin legions with CNNs to identify instances of skin cancer they explore utilizing structured data from patient electronic medical records (EMR) to conduct a similar inference. To extract features relevant to driving the model’s risk prediction they leverage change AUROC in response to removing the corresponding covariate from their model. This method, while computationally intensive, allows them to isolate a series of features related to specific comorbidities and medications that may share either a confounder or causal relationship with non-melanoma skin cancer development. 


Ultimately, I find the work done by this paper to be speculative at best and poor quality data science at worst. Their experimental design for the observational cohort focuses on indexing patients with non-melanoma skin cancer at the point of their diagnosis and then utilizing the three years prior to that index event to establish each patient’s entry point. Their matched controls were merely matched on their final follow-up date. By focusing on a cohort whose common factors are just matching index dates they may be comparing fundamentally different patient populations. Frankly, I think their results only serve to demonstrate how uninformed the cohort’s design really is. Almost all the features they assess are heavily confounded by age. Cirrhosis, Hypertension, COPD, and CKD are all conditions that individuals develop more frequently in their later years of life. Seeing as cancer is causally related to age, this means the two are confounded. They do include age in their feature set, but I think the intersection of the results suggests that including the age covariate is insufficient to address its related care biases. The medications are similarly confounded, aside from antifungal agents, as they are mostly just treatments for the associated comorbid conditions. Finally, I think their method for determining feature importance is non-standard even for the times. By this point model assessment methods like SHAP and LIME were rising in popularity especially when working with RNNs and other deep models. Overall, the paper’s methods feel underbaked and I don’t agree with the insights they’ve drawn from their results.

## Questions:
1. Most of the results derived from this paper appear to follow the pattern of “sicker patients are more likely to have non-melanoma skin cancer legions”. How do they validate, in clinic, that the associations have a deeper biological link than that?
2. The author’s use of an index event retrospective design is odd to me. How can they match on censorship date alone? It almost seems that by doing so they aren’t ensuring that their cohorts are balanced. Could inverse probability weighting be used to match on loss to follow-up more appropriately?
