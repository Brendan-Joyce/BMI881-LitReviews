# 9/22 - NHLBI ~ The Lipid research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial Results parts 1 and 2
## Literature Review
In “The Lipid research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial Results” reports 1 and 2, epidemiologists and doctors from the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) explore the effects of cholestyramine treatment on hypercholesterolemia and downstream conditions linked to the condition; with a keen focus no coronary heart disease (CHD). Both studies work from the same cohort of 3,806 male middle-aged patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and no prior history of CHD. Their first report explores the immediate impact of cholestyramine treatment on patients Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Triglycerides (TG), and High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) levels and CHD outcomes. They leverage common statistical methods of the time for this branch of analysis including Cox Proportional Hazards and life tables. Ultimately, their first report concludes that cholestyramine treatment is sufficient for lowering the risk of CHD and diminishing patient risk of death from CHD in their cohort. Their second report further analyzes the mediating impact of cholestyramine on the CHD outcome by exploring patient risk of death under the treatment effect as a function of total change in patient LDL measurements. In addition to the types of survival analyses conducted in the first report, they conduct a cross-observational analysis on the impact of LDL reduction on patient health outcomes to further their conclusion on which factor is likely causal in the reduction of CHD incidence and severity.


Overall, I find this study to be a rather complete and well executed clinical trial. Their goals and methods are clear and by incorporating external trials they not only establish a descriptive model that tracks the mediating effect of cholestyramine on CHD death but confirm its mediating effect as part of a broader class of hyperlipidemia treatments. Reading this paper, I have no doubts on the quality of their results. With that said, I do have a problem with their cohort. This study exclusively focuses male hyperlipidemia patients aged 42-49. By keeping a narrow age range and focusing solely on males, they can achieve experimental consistency, but the study risks lacking broader generalizability. As such, the value of their hypothesis depends on the importance of their recognition of the mediating effect on LDL levels. I don’t think this isn’t an inherit problem with the trial, especially considering their cohort selection reflects one of the most at-risk target populations, I just consider it to be room for the work to improve.

## Questions:
1.	In this era model coefficients for linear regressions were often just a proxy for addressing confounding bias across the features. Despite this, were the weights learned in this study’s regression ever used in hospital settings for risk prediction?
2.	6 pills a day is a lot to keep track of. Even during the 80s there was extensive research on extended-release (ER) formulations, why didn’t they consider using those to better ensure participant adherence? Was it too expensive? Was ER not well understood for the drug they were studying at the time?
