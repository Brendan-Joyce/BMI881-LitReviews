# 9/9 - Gelman ~ Let's Practice Practice What we Preach: Turning Tables Into Graphs
## Literature Review
The communication of scientific discovery depends on our ability to reliably produce findings and ensure that those findings are accessible both to technical and external audiences. Dr. Gelman explores the importance of how data interpretability enhances scientific accessibility in his article “Let’s practice what we preach ~ Turning Tables into Graphs.” He accomplishes this by discussing how the findings of 7 different articles from the Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA) can be made clearer through the thoughtful consideration of figure representations for dense data tables included in the original manuscripts. In conducting this analysis, he describes a variety of different graphical representations and provides simple explanations for how and why those specific representations were chosen to fit the data displayed in their corresponding tables. Additionally, he identifies robust methods, for the time, through which researchers can make these graphs through tools like S, or its more recent alternative R.

Overall, I find Gelman’s work to be well stated with meaningful examples that support his and frankly my conclusions, but I have some issues with the general structure of the article itself that I think if implemented could produce a more refined final product. First, I think that Gelman’s focus on figure design, while important, neglects the importance of proper formatting. There are several places in his own work where he references figures several pages before those figures are ever displayed. This causes me to need to jump back and forth between the narrative content and his figures to truly glean the key details he is trying to portray from the figures he creates. Accessibility has several dimensions, and I fear that in focusing on data visualization improvements, narrative structure has been slightly neglected. Additionally, this article is completely opinion driven. Even though I agree with him on the improvements his visualizations make, I believe some light experimentation just to gauge reader preference would have made his narrative significantly more impactful.

## Questions:
1.	Data visualizations can often be massaged to make seemingly irrelevant findings appear more impactful and significant than they actually are. How can we effectively combat biased data visualizations to curtail embellishment and potentially misinformation in scientific communication?
2.	Living figures are figures that are capable of either responding directly to user interaction or ongoing changes in the landscape of data sources. Is there any room in modern digital journal systems for living figures embedded directly in journal content?  Would they improve interpretability or just reader engagement?
3.	As editor software improves, infographics have become a more plausible form of information condensation. While typically used to summarize findings, could this be used to describe data?
