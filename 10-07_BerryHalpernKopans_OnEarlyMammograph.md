# 10/7 - Berry ~ Benefits and risks of screening mammography for women in their forties: a statistical appraisal
## Literature Review

Berry’s commentary in “Benefits and Risks of Screening Mammography for Women in Their Forties: a Statistical Appraisal” focuses on conducting a multi-study comparison of clinical trials  aimed at evaluating the impact of mammography screening in women aged 40-49 on the likelihood of breast cancer deaths in the years following the study. His analysis focuses on evaluating the weighted value of each study, both in the context of the follow-up methods each used, and results collected to determine the true value of early mammography screening. Ultimately his study does show a significant reduction in breast cancer deaths; however, this reduction is considerably less meaningful than prior literature had reported, a mere 18% reduction in mortality rate among women receiving mammography in their 40s. In addition to his meta-analysis, he also assesses the quality of each study he compared to one and other. He notes clear issues regarding bias both in timing of mammography relative to study protocol, mortality collection, and individual study size. In a rebuttal to his conclusions Kopans and Halpern argue that Berry’s commentary neglects to recognize the significance of his findings while obsessing over the quality of a specific Canadian clinical trial with suspect design practices. Berry responds by stating that Kopans and Halpern’s statement does not reflect his actual views and fails to interpret the proper conclusions of his work.


Given the conclusions of his work, I find Berry’s perspective regarding early mammography to be reasonable; however, I think his wishy washy tone in his conclusion lends to a less than valid representation of his results. When it comes to clinical care practice it is a given that under sober mind and body the decision to treat ultimately lies in the hands of the patient. While I recognize that Berry may be reiterating this to encourage opening that conversation, his tone and delivery suggest an ire representative of his own opinions on early mammography. Additionally, I find his Bayesian analysis based approach to evaluating the mortality reduction of mammography to be confusing. Given the small cohort sizes, I do not believe he is powered to establish priors for his analysis. With regards to his evaluation of study quality, I looked at the organization of the Canadian clinical trial independently and, despite the larger N of the study, I agree with Kopans and Halpern regarding their concerns with Canadian study’s quality. With that said, I do find Kopans and Halpern’s response to be charged with their own opinions regarding mammography resulting in their argument feeling less objective and more opinionated. Berry’s response is similarly charged, which makes the conversation feel more heated than it needs to be. Overall, I find the discussion started from this paper is not particularly productive, additionally I find Berry’s original analysis applies complex statistics in a way that damages the quality of his findings.

## Questions:
1. Have any studies following this examined the impact of false discovery of breast cancer tumors on patient outcomes? I feel that there is too little discussion on the actual false positivity rate of mammography to really make Berry’s claims resonate with me.
2. I rarely see epidemiological studies leave the frequentist frame of statistics. Is there a reason why methods like the one Berry discussed haven’t really taken off?
3. Mammography for women in their 40s is a lot more common now, what studies cut through the confusion to establish the standards we work with today?
